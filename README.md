Developed a serverless web application leveraging AWS Lambda for backend logic, Amazon API Gateway for exposing RESTful APIs, and Amazon DynamoDB for data storage. Integrated AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for security and permissions. This project demonstrated the ability to create scalable and cost-efficient applications using AWS serverless architecture.
